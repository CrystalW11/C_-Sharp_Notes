`1 hr 21 min` | `Module` | `12 Units`

Learn how to effectively debug C# programs in Visual Studio Code using breakpoints and the other debugging tools, such as resources in the RUN AND DEBUG view.

### Learning objectives


- Configure the Visual Studio Code debugger for a C# program.

- Create breakpoints and step through your code to isolate issues.

- Inspect your program state at any execution step.

- Use the call stack to find the source of an exception.


### Prerequisites


- An installation of Visual Studio Code that's configured for C# application development.

- Ability to develop C# console applications that implement business logic using iteration statements, selection statements, and custom methods.
