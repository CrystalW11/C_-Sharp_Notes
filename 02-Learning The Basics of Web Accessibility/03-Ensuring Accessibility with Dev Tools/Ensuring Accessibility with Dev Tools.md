# Ensuring Accessibility with Dev Tools

**`2 minutes`**

Testing your webpage in various clients and views is as important as testing it in various browsers. This testing might not be practical in all scenarios, and it can miss situations where users use a browser but might have another disability. Fortunately, there are tools that you can use as a developer to gauge the accessibility of your page.

### Contrast checkers

Someone who is color-blind might not be able to differentiate between colors, or might have difficulty working with colors that are similar to one another. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the standards organization for the web, established a rating system for [**`color contrast`**](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html).

Choosing the right colors to ensure that your page is accessible to all can be tricky to do by hand. You can use the following tools to both generate appropriate colors and test your site to ensure compliance:

Palette generation tools:
Adobe Color, an interactive tool for testing color combinations
Color Safe, a tool for generating text colors based on a selected background color
Compliance checkers:
Browser extensions to test a page:
Edge: WCAG Color contrast checker
Firefox: WCAG Contrast checker
Chrome: Colour Contrast Checker
Applications:
