# Prepare

**`9 minutes`**

In this guided project, you'll use Visual Studio Code to develop a C# application. The application will use arrays, `foreach` statements, and `if` statements to implement a list of design parameters. You'll begin by creating the array variables that contain your application data. To complete the project, you'll develop `foreach` and `if` statements that implement the application design goals.

‚ùó**Important**

This module includes coding activities that require Visual Studio Code. You'll need access to a development environment that has Visual Studio Code installed and configured for C# application development.

### Project overview

You're developing a Student Grading application that automates the calculation of grades for each student in a class. The parameters for your application are:

- Create a C# console application.

- Start with four students. Each student has five exam scores.

- Each exam score is an integer value, 0-100, where 100 represents 100% correct.

- A student's overall exam score is the average of their five exam scores.

- Criteria for extra credit assignments:

     - Include extra credit assignment scores in the student's scores array.
     
     - Extra credit assignments are worth 10% of an exam score (when calculating the final numeric grade).
     
     - Add extra credit assignment scores to the student's total exam score before calculating the final numeric grade.
