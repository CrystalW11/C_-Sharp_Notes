# Exercise - Create and configure for iteration loops

**`14 minutes`**

On the surface, the for statement is another iteration statement that allows you to iterate through a code block and thereby change the flow of execution of your code. However, once we examine how each works, we can better identify the nuances of each iteration statement and when to use them.

### What is the `for` statement?

The `for` statement iterates through a code block a specific number of times. This level of control makes the `for` statement unique among the other iteration statements. The `foreach` statement iterates through a block of code once for each item in a sequence of data like an array or collection. The `while` statement iterates through a block of code until a condition is met.

Furthermore, the `for` statement gives you much more control over the process of iteration by exposing the conditions for iteration.

In this exercise, you'll use the `for` statement, learning how to control the iteration's pre-condition, completion condition, its iteration pattern and more. Also, you'll learn of common use cases for the for statement.

Okay, now let's prepare our coding environment and begin our examination of code samples that implement a `for` statement.

### Prepare your coding environment

This module includes hands-on activities that guide you through the process of building and running demonstration code. We encourage you to complete these activities using Visual Studio Code as your development environment. Using Visual Studio Code for these activities will help you to become more comfortable writing and running code in a developer environment that's used by professionals worldwide.

1. Open Visual Studio Code.

     You can use the Windows Start menu (or equivalent resource for another OS) to open Visual Studio Code.

2. On the Visual Studio Code **File** menu, select **Open Folder**.

3. In the **Open Folder** dialog, navigate to the Windows Desktop folder.

     If you have different folder location where you keep code projects, you can use that folder location instead. For this training, the important thing is to have a location thatâ€™s easy locate and remember.

4. In the **Open Folder** dialog, select **Select Folder**.

     If you see a security dialog asking if you trust the authors, select **Yes**.

5. On the Visual Studio Code **Terminal** menu, select **New Terminal**.

     Notice that a command prompt in the Terminal panel displays the folder path for the current folder. For example:

     ```
     C:\Users\someuser\Desktop>
     ```
