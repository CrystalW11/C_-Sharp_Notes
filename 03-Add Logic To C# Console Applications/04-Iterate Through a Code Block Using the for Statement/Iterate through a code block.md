# Iterate through a code block using for statement in C#

**`37 min`** | **`Module`** | **`6 Units`**

Use the for iteration statement to loop a pre-set number of times and control the iteration process.

### Learning objectives

After you complete this module, you'll be able to:


- Use the for statement to loop through a block of code

- Modify how the .NET Runtime executes the looping logic, changing the value of the iterator, the condition and the pattern


### Prerequisites


- Experience creating simple C# applications that include console I/O and access the methods of .NET classes such as String and Random

- Experience using Visual Studio Code to develop, build, and run C# console applications that implement arrays, if-elseif-else statements, and foreach statements

- Experience using C# code to evaluate conditional expressions and manage variable scope inside and outside of code blocks

- Experience using the switch-case construct to match a variable or expression against several possible outcomes
