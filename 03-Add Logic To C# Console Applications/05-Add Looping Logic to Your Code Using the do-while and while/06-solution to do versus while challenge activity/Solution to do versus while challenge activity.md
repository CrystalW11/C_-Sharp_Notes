# Review the solution to do versus while challenge activity

**8 minutes**

The following examples should use a `do` because you know that you need to execute the code block at least once. You CAN also use a while to achieve the same result. Some developers feel that the logic of a while makes the code more readable. If that is the case for you, you can choose to implement a while. In this case, be aware that most code compilers optimize your code for you by converting the iteration statement to a do-while.

Project 1 code
The following code is one possible solution for challenge project 1 from the previous unit.

The code uses a do statement because the code block must be executed at least once. You CAN also use a while to achieve the same result. Some developers may feel that the logic of a while makes the code more readable. If that's the case for you, you can choose to implement a while statement here.
