# Exercise - Complete a challenge activity to differentiate between do and while iteration statements

**`14 minutes`**

Code challenges will reinforce what you've learned and help you gain some confidence before continuing on.

### Examine the difference between do and while statement iterations

As you have seen, C# supports four types of iteration statements: `for`, `foreach`, `do-while`, and `while`. Microsoft's language reference documentation describes these statements as follows:


- The `for` statement: executes its body while a specified Boolean expression (the 'condition') evaluates to true.

- The `foreach` statement: enumerates the elements of a collection and executes its body for each element of the collection.

- The `do-while` statement: conditionally executes its body one or more times.

- The `while` statement: conditionally executes its body zero or more times.

The `for` and `foreach` iterations seem to be clearly differentiated from each other and from the `do-while` and `while` iterations. The definitions for the `do-while` and `while` statements, however, appear to be quite similar. Knowing when to choose between a `do-while` and a `while` seems more arbitrary, and can even be a bit confusing. Some challenge projects may help to make the differences clear.

In this challenge, you'll be presented with conditions for three separate coding projects. Each project will require you to implement an iteration code block using either a `do-while` or a `while` statement. You'll need to evaluate the specified conditions in order to choose between the `do-while` and `while` statements. You can switch after you start if your first choice isn't working out as well as you had hoped.
