# Add looping logic to your code using the do-while and while statements in C#

**`55 min`** | **`Module`** | **`8 Units`**

Use the do-while and while statements to iterate as long as a Boolean expression evaluates to true.

### Learning objectives

After you complete this module, you'll be able to:

- Write code that uses the do-while statement to iterate through a code block

- Write code that uses the while statement to iterate through a code block

- Use the continue statement to step directly to the Boolean evaluation

### Prerequisites

- Experience using Visual Studio Code to develop, build, and run `C# console` applications that include console I/O and access the methods of `.NET `classes

- Experience using `C#` code to evaluate conditional expressions and manage variable scope inside and outside of code blocks

- Experience using if-elseif-else and switch-case statements in `C# `to match a variable or expression against several possible outcomes

- Experience using foreach and for statements in C# to loop through a block of code and access elements of array variables

### This module is part of these learning paths

Add logic to C# console applications (Get started with C#, Part 3)
