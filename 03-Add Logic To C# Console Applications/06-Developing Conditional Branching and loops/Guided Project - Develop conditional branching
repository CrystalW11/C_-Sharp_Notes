Gain experience developing a console app that implements selection and iteration statements to achieve app specifications.

### Learning objectives

In this module, you'll practice how to:

- Use Visual Studio Code to develop a C# console application that uses a combination of selection and iteration statements to implement logical workflows in accordance with supplied application data and user interactions.

- Evaluate the underlying conditions and make an informed decision when choosing between if-elseif-else and switch statements, and between foreach, for, while, and do iteration statements.

- Scope variables at an appropriate level within an application.

### Prerequisites

Experience using Visual Studio Code to develop, build, and run C# console applications that include console I/O and access the methods of .NET classes

Experience using C# code to evaluate conditional expressions and manage variable scope inside and outside of code blocks

Experience using if-elseif-else and switch-case statements in C# to match a variable or expression against several possible outcomes

Experience using foreach, for, do, and while statements in C# to loop through a block of code and access elements of array variables
