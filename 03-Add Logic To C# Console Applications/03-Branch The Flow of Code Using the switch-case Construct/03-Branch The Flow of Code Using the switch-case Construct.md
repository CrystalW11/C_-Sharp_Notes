# Branch the flow of code using the switch-case construct in C#

**`34 min`** | **`Module`** | **`6 Units`**

Learn how to add branching logic that matches one variable or expression against many possible values.

### Learning objectives

After you complete this module, you'll be able to:

- Use the switch-case construct to match a variable or expression against several possible outcomes

- Convert code that uses an if-elseif-else construct into a switch-case construct

### Prerequisites

- Experience creating simple C# applications that include console I/O and access the methods of .NET classes such as String and Random

- Experience using Visual Studio Code to develop, build, and run C# console applications that implement arrays, if-elseif-else statements, and foreach statements

- Experience using C# code to evaluate conditional expressions and manage variable scope inside and outside of code blocks
