# Challenge project - Work with variable data in C#

`43 min` | `Module` | `6 Units`

Demonstrate your ability to develop a console app that implements data formatting and using arrays to deliver a multiple term search feature.

### Learning objectives

- Apply iteration statements using data input.

- Process data.

- Format data output.

- Choose the correct data types and safely converting data types.

- Create and manipulate string arrays, and sort array data.

- Modify and build complex strings from multiple data sources, and format data for display.

### Prerequisites

- Experience using Visual Studio Code to develop, build, and run C# console applications that include console I/O and access the methods of .NET classes.

- Experience using C# code to evaluate conditional expressions and manage variable scope inside and outside of code blocks.

- Experience using if-elseif-else and switch-case statements in C# to match a variable or expression against several possible outcomes.

- Experience using foreach and for statements in C# to loop through a block of code and access elements of array variables.
