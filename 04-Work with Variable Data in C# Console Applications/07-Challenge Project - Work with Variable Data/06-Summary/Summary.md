Your challenge was to update an application to support multiple term search and to improve the "search status" information animation.

In this module, you developed code that combines:


- Iterate using data input.

- Process data.

- Format data output.

- Choose the correct data types and safely convert data types.

- Create and manipulate string arrays, and sort array data.

- Modify and build complex strings from multiple data sources, and format data for display.

You delivered functionality to your Contoso pet app team, including:


- Gather the pet characteristics for multiple search term inputs.

- Store search input terms in a sorted array.

- Display the dogs that have a term match.

- Provide an improved search status animation with a countdown.
