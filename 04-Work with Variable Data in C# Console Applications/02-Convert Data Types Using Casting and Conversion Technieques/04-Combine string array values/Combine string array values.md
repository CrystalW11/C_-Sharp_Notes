# Exercise - Complete a challenge to combine string array values as strings and as integers

**`6 minutes`**

Code challenges reinforce what you've learned and help you gain some confidence before continuing.

This module features two code challenges. This first challenge forces you to split up the data depending on its type and either concatenate or add the data accordingly.

### ‚ùóNote

The code samples in this exercise are designed based on en-US culture settings, and use a period (`.`) as the decimal separator. Building and running the code with a culture setting that uses a different decimal separators (such as a comma `,`) may give unexpected results or errors. To fix this issue, replace the period decimal separators in the code samples with your local decimal separator (such as `,`). Alternatively, to run a program using the en-US culture setting, add the following code to the top of your program: `using System.Globalization;` and after any other using statements add `CultureInfo.CurrentCulture = new CultureInfo("en-US");`.
