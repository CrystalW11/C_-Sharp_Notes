# Format alphanumeric data for presentation in C#

`58 min` | `Module` | `8 Units`


Use C# to format strings with white space, special characters, padding, and alignment. Give context to numeric data like currency, percentages, and numbers with decimals.

#### Learning objectives

- Use character escape sequences to add tabs, new lines, and Unicode characters to our strings.

- Create verbatim string literals, and escape common characters like backslash (` \ `) and double-quotes ( `""` ).

- Merge templates with variables using composite formatting and string interpolation.

- Include various format specifiers for percentages, currency, and numbers.

#### Prerequisites

- Introductory experience with creating and initializing variables of type `string` and `decimal`

- Introductory experience with literal values of type `string` and `decimal`

- Introductory experience with `Console.WriteLine()`

- Experience using Visual Studio Code to develop, build, and run C# code
