# Complete The Challenge to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius

**`10 minutes`**

In this challenge, you'll write code that will use a formula to convert a temperature from degrees Fahrenheit to Celsius. You'll print the result in a formatted message to the user.

### Challenge: Calculate Celsius given the current temperature in Fahrenheit

1. Select all of the code in the .NET Editor, and press `Delete` or `Backspace` to delete it.

2. Enter the following code in the .NET Editor:

     ```
     int fahrenheit = 94;
     ```

3. To convert temperatures in degrees Fahrenheit to Celsius, first subtract 32, then multiply by five ninths (5 / 9).

4. Display the result of the temperature conversion in a formatted message

     - Combine the variables with literal strings passed into a series of `Console.WriteLine()` commands to form the complete message.

5. When you're finished, the message should resemble the following output:

     ```
     The temperature is 34.444444444444444444444444447 Celsius.
     ```

### ‚ùóNote

Admittedly, it is preferred to not see so many values after the decimal point. Ideally the value would be formatted to a single value after the decimal point: `34.4`.
